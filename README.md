Dear Recruiter,
	These are the various projects that I have done in the course of Design Patterns which I pursued in my second semester. They are:

	1. Student Registration (design to interfaces)
	2. Chat Application  (Object Pool with Singleton)
	3. Task Manager (Observer Pattern)
	4. Generic Check Pointing (Dynamic Proxy Pattern with Serialization)
	5. Sorted Insert (Visitor Pattern)
