PURPOSE:

[
  Document here what you perceive as what your project simply tries to
  accomplish. If your project has extra functionality, do not document them
  here, put them in the section titled EXTRA CREDIT below.
]

PERCENT COMPLETE:
[
  I am not sure but I believe I have completed 95% of this project, 
  since I haven't had time to once go over my code to inspect appropriateness of design principles."
]

PARTS THAT ARE NOT COMPLETE:
[
   I have used proper Java principles to write a displayData() method for resultStore class. 
   I debugged code and it takes in the data structure values but shows some problem dispalying the data structure fields
   The same display method I have written for RegistrationStore class and it works perfect.
   I have no idea why it behaves that way.
